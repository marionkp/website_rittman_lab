I am a PhD candidate and neurology registrar in the East of England. My research uses functional imaging in Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration to provide stratification and mechanistic insight to guide emerging and future therapeutic options in these diseases. I aim to explain the relationship between pathological change and clinical manifestation, to identify individuals at greater risk of decline, and to understand how cognition is maintained despite structural change in presymptomatic disease.
