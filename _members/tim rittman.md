My main interest lies in understanding how neurodegnerative disease progresses through the brain, in particular why neurodegenerative disease affect the brain in predictable patterns. To do this I develop computer models of disease processes using imaging, pathology and genetic data.

My clinical interest is in cognitive neurology, particularly Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP) and Corticobasal Degeneration (CBD). These are two rare types of dementia that cause problems with movement and cognition.

I have an interest in public engagement with science through the arts as the scientific adviser to the Folkestone Festival of the Brain, and I am an adviser to the Steering Committee for the World Young Leaders in Dementia.
